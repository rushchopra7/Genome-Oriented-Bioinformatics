# Genome-Oriented-Bioinformatics
6-Month intensive research internship

This was a 6-month internship where this intensive course centers on a project phase where students dive into comparative genomics. Teams will explore lesser-known genes, primarily in mammals and hexapodsâ€”groups chosen for their extensive genomic data and clear gene-function links. Students will identify genes of interest, annotate them, and trace their evolutionary paths using advanced bioinformatics and deep learning tools. Theoretical and practical aspects from evolutionary theory to molecular biology will be integrated, providing a comprehensive understanding of genomics applications.
